Nicotine Minecraft, the best minecraft java ghost client. 

It has over 45 modules, with heavy customizability. Here's all the reasons nicotine is whats happening:

1) Improved performance and optimization:
Nicotine is heavily optimized, meaning even the most potato of PCs can handle it. (Tested on a laptop from 2009.)

2) Seamless cheat integration:
Nicotine has many modules, over 45 of them. All of them have unique enhancements, such as: BedESP, see beds through walls, or Reach, where you can hit enemies from up to 6 blocks away!

3) Anticheat bypass:
nicotine can bypass the anticheat to an extent, so you dont have to worry about bans while closet cheating.
